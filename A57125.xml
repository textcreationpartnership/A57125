            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THe grand Enemy of humane Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, having baffled Man in his firſt Encounter, and cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him of his knowledge and his innocency together, hath ſtudied ever ſince to improve his Follies, and thereby to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat his Miſery. In purſuance of which he ſaw it his concernment, to employ his policy in evacuating thoſe means, whereby the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> might attempt ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of their loſs, and raiſe their Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuals, ſo much depreſſed by the fall which he occaſioned. Well underſtanding, that the intereſt of his Kingdom doth not a little depend upon the <hi>ignorance</hi> of men, as moſt proper to diſpoſe them for his conduct, and that which brings in great throngs of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to him from the <hi>Pagan</hi> World: which
<pb facs="tcp:53201:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>might well add eagerneſs to his induſtry: in ſeeking the advancement of it, in that other part which calls it ſelf <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> And here, becauſe Light had broken forth, his buſineſs was, where he could not compaſs a total extinction of it, either to reſtrain its luſtre, or diſappoint its influence. The former he hath performed among the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, with whom it is ſo muffled, as not to be ſeen by vulgar eyes. The <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church being made a Stove of Devotion, where Religion is hatched in the dark, and men may grow hot with the ſentiments of a fiery zeal, without diſcerning any blaze, or ſpark of knowledge. But when the ſubtil Impoſtor meets with others, that cannot ſpare their ſight, that care not for having their Candle ſhut up in a dark Lanthorn, and that born by another too; adviſed by their differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tempers, he forms new Methods; and ſince they will not be patient without Light, he beſtirs himſelf, either to embaſe its Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or hinder its Efficacy, or counterfeit its Appearance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Its Purity is embaſed,</hi> while it is mixt with ſhadow, with groſs Conceits, wilde Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, perplex Opinions; while obſcured by dark, abstruſe, or imperfect Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; while deflowred by corrupt Gloſſes, and tinctured by ſome ill diſpoſed <hi>Medium,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:53201:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>through which it hath paſt, either in the form of a Verſion, or an Expoſition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is infeebled in its Operation,</hi> and its <hi>Efficacy</hi> obſtructed, when it is eclipſed through the interpoſition of ſome black ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions, or clouded with doubts and ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; when its raies are diſsipated and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed, being ſplit with Diſtinctions, and bandied away in Diſputes; when it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed onely to form the viſible <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Sanctity, to exhibite the glitterings and ſplendors, the quaint colours and imagery of a bare Profeſsion; while it ſerves but to gild mens Diſcourſes, and caſt ſuch a brightneſs upon ſome of their Actions moſt expoſed to obſervation, as may dazzle the eyes of others, that the impieties they more cloſely proſecute, may ſecurely eſcape both their notice and ſuſpicion too. Nor do there want other ſiniſter purpoſes to which it may be applyed; as, the rarifying of mens ſelf-conceit, till it ſwell and puff them up; the inkindling of heart-burnings and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities amongſt them; whileſt all the heat that accompanies the illumination of their mindes is derived upon their paſsions, and ferments their peeviſh humors, till they proceed to ſuch Calentures of contention, as are ever attended with a cold fit of Charity, if not of Piety too. And ſo their Light
<pb facs="tcp:53201:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſerves onely to put out the fire of love, and making the fervency of their ſpirits exhale in their conteſts, leaves them to freez in the ſervice of God, and the concerns of their ſouls: by which means Satan is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gratified, and his deſigns of defeating the moſt neceſſary knowledge not a little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted. He is well content it ſhould ſhine for men to talk, but not to live by: he would either draw them to make an unprofitable uſe of it, or elſe withdraw them from making any at all: which he moſt uſually, and not unſucceſsfully, attempts, by entertaining their mindes with ſo many divertiſements, and diſtracting them with ſuch a variety of objects, as not to give them leave by me ditation to recollect, by a frequent and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reflexion to unite thoſe beams which have disfuſed themſelves there; ſo as to beget a holy fervor within, and produce in the heart ſuch a vital flame, as might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part vigor to the whole man, and warm it into a pious activity. It is none of the leaſt pernicious of the Tempters Arts, to ſet mens Affections at odds with their Judgements, and make their Practice diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from their Principles: which he oft per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms by preſenting to them, in the moſt alluring forms, the various delights of ſenſe, the ſweeteſt and moſt guſtful pleaſures, which
<pb facs="tcp:53201:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>may infuſe ſoft and eaſie prejudices into their minds againſt the ſtrictneſs of their opinions, and releaſe the ſeverities of their deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till their indulgence extend not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the more modeſt ſallies of a luſtful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, but to the bolder excurſions of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute ſenſuality. Hence many live at ſuch a diſtance from their knowledge, that their <hi>Notions</hi> and their <hi>Actions</hi> ſeem to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for very different <hi>Meridians:</hi> it being commonly midnight with the latter, when bright day with the former.</p>
            <p>Thus I have recounted the principal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices, whereby the Prince of Darkneſs ſeeks to undermine and render ineffectual that Light, which men have received from Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation. A third Policy ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, which is, <hi>the counterfeiting of its appearance;</hi> while men are induced to ow their Illumination either to the flaſhes of Fancy, the lightnings of a heated brain, the appearing of <hi>Lucifer</hi> their morning-ſtar, or the riſing of ſome <hi>new Luminary,</hi> to which that <hi>transformed Angel</hi> performs the office of an <hi>Intelligence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The old Sophiſter hath of late earneſtly applyed himſelf to the profeſsion of <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics,</hi> and chiefly taught men that <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment,</hi> in which, by ſhutting out the Light that ſhines in the place where they are, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<pb facs="tcp:53201:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>none but at a little hole, they might have a more pleaſant and delightful view of things; whileſt objects from without ſhould croud in, and offer themſelves to their obſervation in the moſt lovely forms: For he knew, that when mens curioſity had once guided them to the trial hereof, thoſe things which they ſaw right before would now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come invers'd, and be quite otherwiſe repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented: and he, by a convenient diſpoſing and preſenting of Objects, might paint upon their minds what <hi>idea's</hi> he pleaſed; which would be more lively and expreſs, the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er their minds reſembled unwritten paper, by being cleared of what good Principles were imprinted on them before. He hath cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvented many by inviting them out of the <hi>Sun-ſhine</hi> of Divine Ordinances to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh themſelves in the <hi>ſhade,</hi> and take the pleaſures of a retired Walk; where he hath led them on by degrees till the <hi>night</hi> hath overtaken them, and by concealing their way rendred the offer of his <hi>Lanthorn</hi> acceptable, who had ever an <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> or ſome wiſp of error ready, to direct their goings: as not ignorant, that when men are benighted, Lights of this nature will be more admired and followed then all the Stars of Heaven; and there are no better guides to his black Manſion the pit of deſtruction.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:53201:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>He hath a great advantage for impoſing upon ſuch as he hath got into the dark; for here rotten wood will ſhine, and any cheap deluſion ſerve to amuſe the ſight: though ſometimes he may go to the coſt of a more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn cheat, of ſome gariſh apparition or ſplendid diſguiſe of error: yea, he can match Myſtery with falſhood, and teach the moſt ſhallow conceits to be profound. He hath a new-fangled dreſs to recommend the vaineſt and moſt Antic Tenets; and can cloath an ill-contrived opinion with a venerable obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: By this means accommodating himſelf to minds of various conditions; ſome of which are taken with the ſurperficial gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering, others with the intricate dimneſs of what is propounded. But leſt the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of his impoſtures, which have been ſo ſucceſsful, might fall, to ſupport it, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them from being detected, he hath tryed to diſparage all External Light (and Internal too, of which himſelf is not the Author) and diſoblige mens regard, both to Divine Declarations publiſhed in holy Writ, and to the Law of Nature, and thoſe notices of good and evil, which are moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate and familiar to the mindes of men; and, laſtly, to the ſober judgements of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the genuine deductions either of Scriptural or Natural Principles. For it
<pb facs="tcp:53201:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>was eaſie to conclude, that if he could fetch men off from attending to theſe, he himſelf ſhould have leave to indite their Creed, and have their faith pliant to his propoſals: that he might be the Conductor of their Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the <hi>Infernal ſire</hi> lend the <hi>Coal</hi> with which their <hi>Incenſe</hi> ſhould burn.</p>
            <p>But if he cannot deprive the Scripture of that Authority which it carries with men, he will endeavor to hinder them of a great part of the Contents and Advantages of it, by decrying all uſe of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Learning</hi> in ſacred matters. For, if he can prevail with men to renounce the former, then farewel ſo much of the Divine Will, as is not ſet down in Scripture in expreſs terms, but onely, though clearly, implyed, and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from what is written by a fair and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary conſequence; which is the part of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to diſcern and deduce.

For, in as much as theſe are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Scripture immediately connected or mingled together in the ſame tenor of ſpeech, and enjoyned alike, without the leaſt note of diſcrimination; there muſt be ſome other principle diſtinct from it to find out their difference, and that is Reaſon; which (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that it may infer it from the Scripture it ſelf, diſcerning which Commands are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal and perpetual, by collation of other places; which ſingular and temporary, by conſideration of circumſtances) is peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly fitted for acknowledging Moral Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, becauſe they are founded in Reaſon, have an eſſential conſonancy to, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with a rational Nature, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in that Law which God hath written upon the hearts of all men, and publiſh'd by the voice of Reaſon; which indeed is not more
<pb facs="tcp:53201:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>uſeful to diſtinguiſh commands, then neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to render us capable of them. For therefore the bruits are exempted from the demands of obedience, and have no Law impoſed on them, becauſe they being crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures deſtitute of Reaſon, it's impoſsible for them to diſcern the differences of good and evil, or to underſtand an injunction, and conſequently to frame their actions by it: To which men are diſpoſed by thoſe rational faculties with which God hath inveſted them, and ſo come within the compaſs of an obligation, which could not elſe be faſtened upon them. Wherefore <hi>Conſcience,</hi> whoſe part it is to apprehend this obligation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite men to their duty, and challenge them for their neglect, muſt needs be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent and rational Principle; which evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appears in that it operates by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and ratiocination (whence its actings are stiled <gap reason="foreign">

All theſe things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, methinks none ſhould in the least queſtion the requiſiteneſs of Reaſon, without which we can neither think nor ſpeak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently. Yet I finde an Objection,
<note place="margin">Object.</note> urging the impertinency of it in divine matters, from its uncapableneſs of them; becauſe it is ſaid of <hi>the natural man</hi> (one who hath no higher Principle then Reaſon) that he <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives not the things of God,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.14.</note> neither can he know them, ſeeing they are ſpiritually diſcerned?</hi> To which I return,
<note place="margin">Solut.</note> That divine matters, or the things of God, are of two ſorts:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I.</hi> Some of them were publiſh'd in and by the Creation; God having there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived clear intimations of his own nature and minde into the conſtitutions and relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of things, from whence, by a neceſſary reſultancy, many verities and duties ſlow. For thoſe intimations are either <hi>ſpeculative,</hi> as, That <hi>there is a God;</hi> That <hi>he is wiſe, powerful, good,</hi> &amp;c. or <hi>practical,</hi> as, That <hi>God is to be worſhipped;</hi> That <hi>we are to
<pb facs="tcp:53201:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>do as we would be done by;</hi> That <hi>Parents are to be honored,</hi> &amp;c. Now both theſe Reaſon may finde out by reflexion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, by conſidering the quality of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and their intrinſic and eſſential re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects; and conſequently natural Men, though <hi>Heathens,</hi> may apprehend them. The Speculative they may, becauſe God hath ſhewed theſe to them by the things which he hath made, <hi>Rom. 1.19, 20.</hi> And the Practical, becauſe they have <hi>the work of the Law written in their hearts,</hi> and, while they want the Scripture, <hi>do by Nature the things contained in the Law,</hi> Rom. <hi>2.14, 15. By Nature,</hi> that is, by the information of Reaſon (the onely knowing Principle in the Nature of Man) which, though imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, dictates to them the ſame things that the Moral Law, ſet down in holy Writ, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. And though it diſcover not all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Precepts, yet when it hath received them from the Word of God, and wiſtly looks upon them, it cannot but acknowledge and embrace them with ſome natural reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as akin to thoſe Principles of prime note, that are neareſt alied to, and have the ſtricteſt conjunction with it ſelf; which are ſo highly reaſonable, and of ſo clear and conſpicuous a Goodneſs, that it can readily approve, and eaſily evince the dueneſs and
<pb facs="tcp:53201:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>equitableneſs of what it ſees deſcended from them. Hence that of our Savior to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>Luke 13.57. Yea, and why even of your ſelves judge ye not what is right? Of your ſelves;</hi> i. e. by that natural abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which God hath given you for this very purpoſe, to diſtinguiſh between Right and Wrong, and diſcern what is in it ſelf fit to be done, and what not?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>II.</hi> There are other divine matters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared onely by after-revelation, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſsibly be collected, and certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the eſſence, capacity, or habitude of the things to which they relate, becauſe they do not reſult from them by any moral neceſsity, but are the intire effects of a free and poſitive Determination; the knowledge of which had been utterly unattainable, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the greateſt ſagacity, if the ſame gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Will that conceiv'd had not diſcloſed it. Now of this ſort are the Myſteries of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,</hi> call'd the <hi>depths</hi> and <hi>hidden wiſdom of God, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>2.7, 10.</hi> and <hi>the things of the Spirit of God,</hi> verſe <hi>14.</hi> And of theſe it is that the Apoſtle aſſerts the natural Man wholly inapprehenſive without the Spirit. <hi>He receives them not.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:53201:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>except the Spirit had revealed them in the Word: ſeeing they were the ſecrets of the divine Breaſt, the ſtupendious products of his good pleaſure, and ſuch as could not fall within the compaſs of man's imagination, much leſs of his certain knowledge, if they had not been preſented to him from above. For he could not deduce them from the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of which he is naturally poſſeſs'd, ſince they have no neceſſary dependance on them; being of a quite different condition, becauſe the matter of the other is neceſſary; of theſe, arbitrary.

Except therefore that Act, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Heaven, to which they owe their conjunction, were promulged, the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions which they make up, could they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
<pb facs="tcp:53201:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>have been thought of, yet could upon no ground have been aſſented to. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; Theſe Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, That <hi>Eternal life is to be had by the death of Chriſt,</hi> and that <hi>we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> are not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced by any neceſſary relation, or intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal and natural tie between their ſubject and predicate (between Eternal life, and Chriſts death; between Believing and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion) and could not have been rightly credited, had we not been expreſly acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that determination of infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that hath joyned them together. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in thoſe axiomes, that <hi>God is to be loved,</hi> and that <hi>he is to be honored,</hi> there is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate and eſſential a connexion between the parts (between God, and the right to love and honor) that he, who ſeriouſly attends thereto, may from thence, without any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Revelation, be conſtrained to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them undeniably true, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all acceptation: ſince it is impoſsible that love and honor, if due to any excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, ſhould not be ſo to the greateſt and moſt tranſcendent.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The natural Man is not able through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>penetrate into, and comprehend</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Mysteries without the illumination of the Spirit, distributed betwixt the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb facs="tcp:53201:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>and the Faculty, whileſt it ſheds light upon the things revealed, repreſenting them to the minde with the greateſt evidence and advantage; and alſo aſsiſts and furthers Reaſon in the perception of them, clearing and ſtrengthening it, and removing thoſe prejudices under which it labored.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

He can have no experimental feeling, no kindly and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent impreſsions, no enlivening ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of them.</p>
            <p>Now take any, or all of the foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Senſes, and what do they make againſt the uſe of Reaſon in religious affairs? Will any one ſay, that becauſe it can have no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of ſupernatural Myſteries before they be revealed, therefore it cannot appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them when they are revealed? He may as well conclude, that becauſe he cannot now look upon any of the Gold at preſent hap'd up in the <hi>Indian</hi> Mines; therefore, if it were taken out, brought over and laid before him, he ſhould not be able to diſcern it. Or who would argue, that ſince his eyes are dim, or have a web grown upon them; therefore if ever he ſee well, it muſt be without eyes? And yet thus they do, who, becauſe their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb facs="tcp:53201:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>is weak, and wants much of its Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive vigor and ſharpneſs, caſt it away as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to any ſpiritual employment: which is to act at the ſame rate of diſcretion with him, who ſhould make blindneſs the cure of dimneſs, and put out his eyes to mend his ſight. The Spirit performs to our mindes the office of a <hi>Perſpective,</hi> rendring thoſe things conſpicuous which were before invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and giving a diſtincter view of what was leſs clearly ſeen. Now a Perſpective ſuppoſeth a viſive faculty, to which it ministers relief. No man would be ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd as to think that he who hath got ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles hath no need of eyes:
<note place="margin">☜</note> and yet he might, as well as conceit him who hath the Spirit to have no uſe of Reaſon. For this makes us capable of the operation and impreſsions of the Spirit, of apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he ſuggeſts, and ſo of being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with it, both becauſe affection ever ſuppoſeth an apprehenſion of the thing that excites it; and the moſt refined and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual affections are the workings of our ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional part. Reaſon is the ſenſe of our ſouls; by this, when the Spirit hath put it into a right temper, we may ſee, and ſavor the things of God, and can ſee no more without it, then we can view or reliſh material objects without either ſight or taſte.</p>

            <p>But I have outrun my intentions in the purſuit of a Queſtion, which nothing but a notorious ignorance or a great perverſeneſs could ever have ſtarted. The rather indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced hereto, becauſe many of thoſe, who were no Friends to Learning, were oppoſers of Reaſon alſo; who now poſsibly may be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſilent then ſatisfied. And though, ſince the Scene of affairs was altered, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits walk not ſo much abroad as formerly, yet they may ſtill keep within doors: upon which account an attempt of this nature, in vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of Reaſon, may not be impertinent; onely it is ſo to be vindicated, as that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing above its due be aſcribed to it; none of its extravagancies juſtified: it is by no means to be allowed when it grows immodeſt and imperious, and ſo big with Uſurpation as to control the dictates of Heaven, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proclaim its own infallibity, and to baniſh faith out of Religion: which it doth, when men will not admit of Divine Authority in any matters of which they are not able in all points to give a clear and natural account: for they muſt either ſuſpect Gods credit, or prefer their own judgements before his, or at leaſt attribute as great perfection to their own underſtandings, as Omniſcience it ſelf can challenge; as if nothing were too won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful for them: whereas indeed the
<pb facs="tcp:53201:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſlighteſt and moſt obvious of theſe inferiour things are of ſufficiency enough to <hi>poſe</hi> and <hi>baffle</hi> them.

For, though it be moſt certain, that God offers no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be credited by us, which is contrary to the ſound dictates of Reaſon (whereof he is the Author) or which would deſtroy the clear and indubitable evidence of thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning faculties, which God hath beſtowed upon us; ſeeing one Truth can be no more contrary to another, Scriptural to Rational, Supernatural to Natural, then God, who is the ſource of both, can be adverſe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or be guilty of ſelf-contradiction: Yet it is as certain that he can preſent ſome Truths of ſo vaſt a bigneſs, as that to take the full dimenſions thereof, would be difficult above what the ſhortneſs of the moſt raiſed mind, in this preſent ſtate, can hope to attain to. No underſtanding, but that which is ſo large as that nothing can

As for the Book it ſelf, though the deſign of it principally reſpected thoſe who ſlighted or were diſſatisfied with Humane Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, yet it was not ſo narrow, as not to be comprehenſive of others too, who profeſs reſpect to it. Amongſt whom thoſe may more eſpecially claim an intereſt in the aſsiſtance which it offers, who either are better vers'd in the general <hi>Elogiums</hi> of Learning, then in the particular offices of the ſeveral parts thereof; or elſe more ready at the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it as propoſed in Syſtemes, then at the diſcerning of thoſe improvements that may be made of it in reference to Divinty, and what tribute the ſeveral Arts and Sciences

            <p>Liberal and uſeful Erudition ows moſt of the diſparagement at any time caſt upon it, either to the ſloath or unskilfulneſs of thoſe that have given up their names to it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe too much unfurniſhed to produce any thing worthy of their education, or thoſe juſt expectations which that hath raiſed in others. Their ſtock being ſo ſlender, and ſo pitifully managed, comes to nothing, and ſerves onely to make them, with greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and oſtentation, betray their own weakneſs, and invite deriſion. Nor are thoſe to be excuſed, who, though better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of Academical improvements, yet not maintaining their familiarity with their Studies, grow ſo negligent and loath to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow any pains upon thoſe performances which their charge exacts from them, that the crudeneſs of them renders them diſguſted of others, and their conceptions become as je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>june and void of any ſprightful reliſh, as if their minds had never received any Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial ſeaſoning, nor were tinctured with any principles beſides thoſe which are ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily found among the vulgar throng of men.
<pb facs="tcp:53201:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>What proceeds from them is of ſuch a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it might better become ſome rude and unpoliſh'd heads.

Let Students therefore henceforward, as they would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the ſincerity of their affection to good Literature, reckon themſelves concerned to uſe ſuch an induſtry in the proſecution of it, as may correſpond with its dignity and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and enable them to give ſuch real demonſtrations of its ſingular advantages, as may anſwer the largeſt reports that are made thereof. By this means they may reſcue it from that ſcorn and contempt, to which the weakneſs of ſome, the lazineſs of others, and the unprofitableneſs of both have made it obnoxious.</p>

Now if ſuch as theſe condemn all acquired knowledge, they have more need to rectifie their judgement, then others to matter it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> Interrogatory is, Whether the diſpleaſure they conceive againſt Learning, and the <hi>invectives</hi> they ſpend upon it, be not the reſults of <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>envy?</hi> Whether through the conſciouſneſs of their own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections they be not afflicted with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb facs="tcp:53201:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>accompliſhments they behold in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and impatient of being out-ſtript, endeavor to bring down thoſe to their own <hi>level</hi> by <hi>detraction,</hi> to whoſe <hi>pitch</hi> they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired of <hi>riſing</hi> by <hi>imitation?</hi> For it is a weakneſs incident to mean abilities, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves as the <hi>ſtandard</hi> from which all others ſhould receive their juſt proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and to be offended at that <hi>depth,</hi> which is greater then their own <hi>ſhallows.</hi> So thoſe that go but a ſlow pace themſelves, whether through feebleneſs or liſtleſsneſs, uſe to be vex'd at the quickneſs of others, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily learn to be ſo dull, nor frame to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed at that ſluggiſh rate.</p>
            <p>I am ſtrongly inclined to think, that many mens diſſatisfaction grows hence, not that <hi>Science</hi> is <hi>not good,</hi> but that it is <hi>not theirs:</hi> Not that they diſcover not a brisk, and amiable luſtre in thoſe Pearls with which the Ring of <hi>Arts</hi> is all beſet; but that they have not the wearing of it. 'Tis the <hi>excentricalneſs</hi> of their capacities, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are out of the circle, that makes all the <hi>Diſciplines</hi> in the <hi>Encyclopaedia</hi> ſeem <hi>irregular.</hi> And this may the rather be thought, becauſe if ſuch men have got but a ſmall pittance of Erudition, they will think never the worſe of themſelves for it, nor refuſe its help, but uſe and ſhew it when
<pb facs="tcp:53201:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>ever they would ſet off themſelves moſt, yea when they declaim againſt it; hereby teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Tongues to accuſe themſelves of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice.</p>
            <p>If we reſpect parallel inſtances, we may find, that thoſe, whoſe ambition is too great for their merits, and their hopes too ſmall for their ambition, being deſtitute of means to advance them to any conſiderable eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſometimes cry out of all preferment, dignities and honorable diſtinctions of men, earneſtly contending that there ought to be an equality amongſt them in condition, as well as there is in blood and excellency of nature: hereby deluding their aſpiring thoughts with a pleaſing ſatisfaction of bringing others to be like them, while they cannot attain to be like others. Again, we ſee ſome (in whom a greedy minde meets with a ſlender eſtate, and that not capable of acceſsion or improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) diſſemble their covetouſneſs in a ſcorn and contempt of riches; and uſe all the Rhetoric they have to prove that ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſluous which they have not. But when any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity ſhall preſent either honor to the former, or wealth to the latter, they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them with as affectionate embraces, as before they ſlighted them with feigned pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. Nor is the caſe otherwiſe here. Thoſe who are not inveſted with the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb facs="tcp:53201:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>and accompliſhments of the minde, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by learned Inſtructions, and liberal Studies, ſeek to diſgrace what they cannot enjoy, and by their reproaches to ſully the attainments of ſome, and check the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors of others, that ſo they may bring all to the like nakedneſs with themſelves. Yet certainly could they once be made maſters thereof, they would be ſo far from rejecting them, as to give them a cordial welcome, and recant their former calumnies in ample commendations. It's not unuſual for great perfections to ſuffer diminution by their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and appear the leſs becauſe far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the beholders reach. And 'tis well known, that where Envy is judge, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency it ſelf is a crime. This ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows the worſt looks upon the beſt Objects, and deſigns the blackeſt Brands to what is brighteſt and moſt illuſtrious. But what Envy reads evil, Propriety corrects and ſigns good. If thoſe men were but intitled to the eminent endowments, which they are now diſaffected to while they ſhine in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they would ſoon be abſolved from all their faults, and clear up into an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained innocency. Yea, the attempts of Envy are ſo inſeparably compounded with Folly, that it cannot but diſappoint its own intentions, and while it goes about to blot
<pb facs="tcp:53201:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>the reputation of Learning, it's conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſubſcribe to its worth, being it ſelf as plain a confeſsion of the excellency of that which it ſeeks to deprave, as it is a clear diſcovery of the narrowneſs of thoſe ſpirits in which it reſides. To whom I ſhall onely ſay, that what is worthy in it ſelf is never the worſe becauſe they want it. And to thoſe, whoſe ſcruples againſt ſo uſeful a good as ingenuous Literature, whether riſing in their own breaſts, or received from others, grow from want of acquaintance with it, I ſhall addreſs but this one requeſt, That they will be pleaſed either to apply their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors to the acquiring of it, and ſo ſuffer their judgements to be led by their experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; or elſe ſeriouſly to weigh the various advantages of it, as they are repreſented in the following Diſcourſe, and then calmly infer the moſt rational concluſion. For that plainly evinceth, that it is not ſo eaſie a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as many imagine to be well accompliſh'd for the Miniſterial Profeſsion. No ſmall variety, no inconſiderable proportion of knowledge will ſerve the turn. He muſt liſten to the <hi>Tongues,</hi> be skill'd in the <hi>Arts,</hi> adviſe with the ſeveral <hi>Sciences,</hi> and be more then ſuperficially converſant in all, who would fully penetrate into the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſacred Writ, and be true to thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
<pb facs="tcp:53201:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>which conſign him to that excellent function. The Languages eſpecially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their own requiſitneſs, while they tell us all that we can know of the ſecrets of Heaven, and the concernments of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Theſe are the Veſſels in which divine Truths ſet ſail from Heaven with the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things of the Spirit, and ſince arrived at us from thoſe forreign Parts, for which they were firſt bound; and are not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laded of their rich fraught, but by ſuch as are well accuſtomed to them. It renders the ſtudy of words neceſſary, that they are the repreſentatives of things, the conveyances of Conceptions, the inſtruments of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, by which we may be let into the breaſt of another, and partake of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret thoughts. Which is moſt true of thoſe Words in which the Scriptures were origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally dictated <hi>(Hebrew, Chaldee, Greek)</hi> becauſe they preſent the onely authentic <hi>Manifeſto,</hi> and the ſincereſt Expreſs of the pleaſure of God (no other ſo ſecurely admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us to a participation of divine Counſels: ſeeing thoſe terms muſt needs give the moſt certain aſpect of the Authors minde, in which he himſelf hath choſen to exhibite it:) and therefore are moſt induſtriouſly to be conſulted by all thoſe who deſire a through inſight into it themſelves, and undertake
<pb facs="tcp:53201:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Explication of it to others; leſt they either miſconſtrue it, or elſe apprehend not the full importance of it; which thoſe that ever adhere to a <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving themſelves the trouble of a further ſearch, are liable to. For there are many times ſo great elegancies and ſuch ſignificant force in the Text, as muſt be in vain expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the moſt exquiſite attempts of any Tranſlation. Which (though it ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no diſadvantage from the Renderers, a priviledge which few enjoy) yet it might through an infelicity of expreſsion, charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able onely upon the Language in which it is framed, be unable to deliver that pregnancy of conception which is conſpicuous in the Original: the neareſt way to give an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it, being to go about by a larger circuit of words then is permitted to the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of a Verſion. For Tongues have their differing <hi>genius:</hi> and one can breathe as much in an accent or two, as will ſerve an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to run with to a full ſtop: and crouds ſuch efficacy into a ſingle clauſe, as, when poured forth into another kinde of Speech, may repleniſh the large receit of an intire Period; and yet happily remain inexhauſted. Thus it fares with thoſe Languages, in which the Will of God was primitively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered; which in divers places are ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiouſly
<pb facs="tcp:53201:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>copious, as to diſcloſe that in a few words, which will give an Interpreter a ſufficient task to repreſent in many: and ſometimes diſplay ſo <hi>rich</hi> a Senſe, as other Languages are ſcarce able to tell the <hi>value</hi> of, or ſum up, without the omiſsion of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>items</hi> in their account. The ſearching out of which might deliver that pleaſure and ſatisfaction to the minde, which would be a ſufficient price and compenſation of the pains beſtow'd thereon. The <hi>milk</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> is then moſt <hi>ſincere,</hi> when drawn im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from thoſe full <hi>breaſts,</hi> the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Texts: whereas it becomes more <hi>dilute</hi> by being ſiled through a Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where, part of the <hi>cream</hi> ſticking in the paſſage, it loſeth ſomewhat of its deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and genuine <hi>reliſh.</hi> This <hi>water of life,</hi> when carried away from its <hi>fountain</hi> by derivation into other Tongues, doth not always retain its high guſt and generous Spirit; but ſometimes is more flat, and ſavors of the veins through which it paſs'd; exchanging an unimitable ſweetneſs for ſome auſtere quality. And here, not to make particular mention of any of thoſe neatneſſes and beauties, thoſe illuminations and graces of Speech, which are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per embelliſhments of that faſhion of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage wherewith the Will of God was

            <p>By this time it may ſufficiently appear, that unlearned perſons are unfit to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Explication of God's Word, which the Apoſtle confirms, whileſt he chargeth them with <hi>wreſting the Scriptures to their own deſtruction, 2</hi> Pet. <hi>3.16.</hi> If any lay the ſame Action againſt learned men, let them conſider, that when ſuch diſtort any inſtance of ſacred Writ, it is no effect of their Learning, but either of their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, becauſe they do not know enough; or of their perverſneſs, and the depravedneſs of their minds, which diſpoſeth them either
<pb facs="tcp:53201:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>to diſſemble the Truth they have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of, or to entertain ſuch erroneous Conceits as may beſt comply with their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt inclinations. And though they may put falſe Gloſſes upon Scripture, and ſet Learning upon the Rack to force out ſome Teſtimony to their Forgeries; yet, what ever ſhallow heads may imagine, it will appear to him that throughly examines what ever they can ſqueez out of it, that it hath not ſpoken any thing which imports a real De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and Confirmation of them: and therefore is no more liable to be taxed upon this account, then the Scripture is worthy of blame, for being conſtrained to attend on unskilful Men, who lean upon it while they ſacrifice to their unſound Opinions. It is the lot of the moſt excellent things to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to abuſe, which is not the natural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of their own qualities, but of mens vices, and therefore miniſters no juſt ground either of their rejection or diſparagement. They argue but at a pitiful rate, who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome men do hurt with their Learning by miſapplying it, and others do no good with it while they neglect to uſe it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conclude it a thing of no worth and goodneſs, but in it ſelf offenſive and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowable. Such may do well to conſider what Anſwer they will return to the ſame
<pb facs="tcp:53201:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>Argument, when levelled againſt the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Word of God; when it ſhall be objected, That it is of pernicious conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, at leaſt unprofitable, for private men to have familiar acquaintance with holy Writ; for many have from hence taken the occaſion of groſs Conceptions, and by it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended Poſitions both ſtrange and impious; and others have been careleſs of imploying their knowledge to the purpoſes of a holy life. Its probable they would anſwer, that there are many private Chriſtians well verſed in Gods Book, who are not chargeable with either of theſe imputations, but make good uſe of their knowledge; and that others do not is their own fault. The like ſay I of Learning, which is not the worſe (any more then the former knowledge) becauſe ſome that have it are ſo bad. It hath done ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſervice in many, and would not have failed to have done ſo in more, had it been rightly managed. Arts themſelves are not to be loaded with the Artiſts guilt. Who will condemn all Trades for diſhoneſt, becauſe there are none but have ſome diſhoneſt men of them? And why ſhould ingenuous litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be more prejudiced by the irregularities of ſome that profeſs it? God himſelf hath given a ſignal Teſtimony to its excellency and uſefulneſs, by chooſing Perſons of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt

<pb facs="tcp:53201:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>to deal in thoſe petty fallacies that intangle mute and unwary fiſhes, on a ſudden created unparallel'd Linguiſts, and made the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of many Languages; having matter to ſupport their words, high impartance to recommend their matter, myſteriouſneſs to enhance the eſtimate of that importance, and clearneſs of underſtanding to unfold that myſteriouſneſs. But ſince the primitive Times we have no example of any in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant furniſhed with miniſterial endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or whoſe intellectuals all on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and without any culture, have ſhot up to a conſiderable height. Indeed there have not wanted ſome of late, who (their ambition leading them to affect the dignity of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, and withall prompting an impatience of aſcending thereto by <hi>degrees</hi>) found out a way, by pretending a divine <hi>Mandate,</hi> at the firſt ſtep to go out <hi>Doctores Illuminati:</hi> though their Letters were never made Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, nor had the Seal of Heaven upon them; and their undertakings witneſſed one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a great weakneſs matched with an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary confidence.

<pb facs="tcp:53201:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>from a diſheveled blaze. How great things ſo ever they boaſted of, yet that their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances were a ſhame to their pretences is ſufficiently known. Seeing then the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications requiſite to the underſtanding and diſpenſation of the Goſpel are not now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on a ſudden, they muſt either be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by little and little, or not at all; by the ordinary aſsiſtance of the Spirit in the way of an induſtrious diligence and artificial improvements; by adviſing with the Tongues about the Words, with Grammar and Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toric about the Senſe, with Logic about the argument of Scripture, with History about Cuſtoms, and with the ſeveral Sciences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thoſe things which are of Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Conſideration. Concerning which I ſhall ſay nothing, having already ſlip'd into too great a prolixity; but ſhall conclude with this <hi>vote,</hi> That, ſince <hi>Learning</hi> is now grown into credit again, thoſe that own it would not ſuffer any ſtain and diſreputation to be cast upon it by the neighborhood of a vitious practiſe, nor maintain a ſeparation between Knowledge and Piety; but preſent them to the World embracing each other in the fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est cloſure, and diſcover the light of their minds in the luſtre of their lives.

                  <p>Skill in the Languages is a Key that unlocks and opens all theſe, and lets a man into the knowledge of them all. It is (as one ſaith) that to a Miniſter, which the Sea is to an Haven-town, to bring in all

                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> are the <hi>Original Tongues,</hi> in which the Old and New Teſtaments were written. A competent knowledge of theſe Tongues gives a man great light to the right and clear underſtanding of the Original Text; and much ſatisfaction and delight to his minde: without ſome inſight into the ſame, a man cannot underſtand the proper Signification and Emphaſis of Words, Phraſes, and Proverbs; nor the Idiomes or peculiar forms of ſpeaking, which the Originals (eſpecially the <hi>Hebrew</hi>) have in them; but he muſt ſee onely with other mens eyes; and take both the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Interpretation of the Scripture upon truſt from others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Great Skill in the <hi>Original Languages</hi> is neceſſary to the <hi>true Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:53201:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the Bible into other Tongues; and to the <hi>ſerene, ſound,</hi> and <hi>proper expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> thereof. For the Minde of God (as Divines obſerve) is <hi>primarily</hi> in the <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> and but <hi>ſecondarily</hi> in the <hi>Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> which no farther contains the Word of God in it, then it agrees with the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, out of which it is tranſlated.</p>
                  <p>This Difference muſt be put between the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Text of the Old and New Teſtament, and the <hi>Latine</hi> and all other <hi>Verſions,</hi> that in the <hi>Original</hi> Text, <hi>&amp; Res &amp; Verba,</hi> both the Matter and the Words proceed immediately from the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> who ſuggeſted to the Prophets, Apoſtles, and Evangeliſts, <hi>&amp; quae ſcriberent, &amp; quomodo ſcriberent;</hi> both what and how they ſhould write. In <hi>Verſions</hi> (that are faithful) the <hi>Doctrine</hi> is from the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> the <hi>Words</hi> are from <hi>Men:</hi> who although they uſe the help of the Holy Ghoſt, yet not in that maner nor meaſure with the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53201:35"/>and miſtakes, and ſupply the defects that ſtill remain in them.</p>
                  <p>Divines obſerve, that much Divinity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on ſmal Particles, upon ſuch a Mood, Tenſe, Caſe, or Number; ſometimes upon one letter, upon pricks and points. Many errors have been bred and fed by <hi>falſe Tranſlations,</hi> and miſtakes of Words and Letters, and by corrupt Gloſſes thereupon.</p>
                  <p>The holy Scriptures are vindicated, and many Truths are reſtored and confirmed by a rectified Tranſlation, and ſound in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of them according to the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Critical learning,</hi> and <hi>Scholia's,</hi> are of excellent uſe hereunto. Many learned Authors in theſe later times have perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the ſame exquiſitely beyond the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs of the ancient Fathers; as <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, Beza, Piſcator, Druſius, Salmaſius, Caſaubon, Grotius, Scaliger, Fuller, Ludo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vick de Dieu, Heinſius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No Tranſlation expreſſeth all places exactly, but ſometimes gives either not the <hi>right,</hi> or not the <hi>full</hi> ſenſe.</p>

                  <p n="2">II.

For the <hi>Jews</hi> returning from <hi>Babylon,</hi> having there forgot their own Language, the <hi>ancient Hebrew</hi> (which,
<note place="margin">Bibl. Polyglot.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53201:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>and altered it ſomewhat,
<note place="margin">See Freerwoods Enquiries, cap 9</note> by framing it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the faſhion of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-Language: and afterwards it grew more impure, by the Addition of <hi>Arabic, Greek, Latine,</hi> and other <hi>exotic</hi> words.</p>
                  <p>The old <hi>Babylonian Syriac,</hi> thus cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, is that which now carries away the Name of <hi>Syriac:</hi> and it divides it ſelf principally into <hi>two Dialects:</hi>

                  <head>SECT. VIII. <hi>Of Hiſtory as uſeful to know Gods works.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>SEcondly, <hi>Hiſtory</hi> is uſeful to a Miniſter <hi>for knowing the works of God,</hi> which are great and manifold, and declared by it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hiſtory</hi> is the <hi>Theatre</hi> and <hi>repreſentation</hi> of God's <hi>providence,</hi> (or divine diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) as it exerciſeth and manifeſteth it ſelf in managing the affairs of the world; but eſpecially in reference to his children, and to his cauſe; in the preſervation of his Church and Truth, notwithſtanding the cruelty of Tyrants, and ſubtilty of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, deſigning the extirpation of the one, and corruption of the other.</p>
                  <p>Herein are legible God's wonderful <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> and deliverances of his ſervants, and his judgements upon the wicked, in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial upon the oppoſers of his Truth, and the perſecuters of his ſervants, and the <hi>conſtancy</hi> of thoſe many <hi>Martyrs,</hi> who ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Truth with their blood. All which may contribute much to the confirming of our belief of it, and the convincing of others.</p>
                  <p>Without <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> how much of the manifeſtation and appearances of God in the world, how many eminent and ſignal
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53201:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>inſtances of his wiſdom, power and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, would be loſt.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>declaring of God's doings among the people</hi> is that the Scripture calls for, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.11. and to whom doth this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, if not to God's Miniſters? and what greater help to this, next the word of God, then <hi>Hiſtory?</hi> ſure, he that is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with it will be a Scribe better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, and more able to bring forth of his Treaſury things both new and old.</p>
                  <p>Men are ordinarily more <hi>awakened</hi> and <hi>affected</hi> with the Hiſtorical Relations, and lively Deſcriptions (becauſe they come neareſt to ſenſible repreſentations) of ſuch paſſages, or providential diſpenſations to any, wherein the mercy or diſpleaſure of God is conſpicuous, then if they only hear promiſes or threatnings. It would ſtrike the minde with far more horror, to hear of the dreadful calamity brought upon the <hi>Jews</hi> by the <hi>Romans,</hi> after they had crucified <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to have the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of their miſery recounted, then only to read <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s words where he denounceth deſtruction againſt them, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.43.</p>

                  <p>THirdly, For <hi>knowing and improving the examples of men,</hi> their <hi>vertues</hi> and <hi>vices.</hi> By Hiſtorical relations we have the benefit of others good examples, and the comfort of their experiences; which may be improved (as well as the various paſſages of God's providence, both mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and judgements) by the Miniſters of the Goſpel, to the exciting or ſupporting of others, as occaſion is offered. And ſince men are ſo apt to be led by examples, he that is a good Hiſtorian hath a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for the drawing and working upon others; to make an apt application of ſtories and examples, (providential and perſonal) which is often much moving and taking with the auditors.</p>
                  <p>This uſe of <hi>Hiſtory</hi> approacheth very near <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s way of teaching by Parables; in many of which, there is as it were an application of an Hiſtorical paſſage to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and ſpiritual purpoſes.</p>

               <p>It may be needful to know the times of the reigns of Heathen Kings and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, becauſe ſome paſſages of Sacred ſtory refer to them; as Chriſt's birth; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> to <hi>Judea,</hi> to be <hi>taxed in the dayes of Ceſar Auguſtus, Luke</hi> 2.1. to 8. the <hi>great dearth</hi> which <hi>Agabus</hi> propheſied, that came to paſs in the days of <hi>Claudius Ceſar</hi> the Emperor, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.28.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Voſsius</hi> ſpeaks of his meeting with ſome, not verſed in the Doctrine of Times,

               </p>
               <p>From the Premiſes it appears, that <hi>Chronology</hi> is of great uſe to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Scriptures, which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act in the Computation of times; and to the clear and diſtinct referring of Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences or paſſages in Scriptures to their
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53201:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>proper Times. The knowledge of the Times when, as well as of the Places where, perſons lived, and things were done, tends much to the elucidating of them, and is very delightful. As God made eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing beautiful in his time, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.11. ſo there is beauty, ſatisfaction and pleaſure in the knowing the times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, wherein things were done, or came to paſs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ignorance of times</hi> leads men into miſtakes about paſſages of Scripture. Thus ſome have thought that the ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack at <hi>Melita,</hi> Act. 27. was one of the three mentioned by <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.25. whereas the ſecond Epiſtle to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> was writ long before that ſhipwrack. So <hi>Capellus</hi> (out of <hi>Baronius</hi>) <hi>in Hiſtor. Apoſtol. pag.</hi> 63.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chronology</hi> is the key for the right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the <hi>Prophets:</hi> to know the times, to which they refer, and the things acted in thoſe times,

               <p>So the <hi>number</hi> of 25 is Remarkable in <hi>Rome,</hi> and much affected by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> in many reſpects. For <hi>Rome</hi> had 25 Gates (as <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> 12,

               <p>Their <hi>Jubilee</hi> is every 25 year: their chief Holy-days, are upon the 25 day of the moneth: and <hi>Bartholomew</hi>-feaſt is cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated at <hi>Rome</hi> on the 25 of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> though in all other places one day ſooner.

               <p>The <hi>Maſs</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s 5 wounds, 5 times multiplied and repeated (which makes 25) will (ſay they) cure all diſeaſes, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſouls from pains. So that they of <hi>Rome</hi> acknowledge ſome great myſtery

               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> in his Expoſition on <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.18. following <hi>Junius</hi> in his Notes on that Text, would have 6 to be multiplied by 10 (to make up 666.) So 10 times 6 is 60, and 10 times 60 is 600. <hi>Six</hi> is made the <hi>baſis,</hi> becauſe there are ſix Books of <hi>Decretals</hi> (of which the ſixth is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, being compiled by Pope <hi>Boniface,</hi>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:53201:106" rendition="simple:additions"/>and called <hi>Sextus,</hi> in which the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Canons are ſummed up) which are a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain platform of Direction for all matters of Practice and Maners in the Diſcipline of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church. So <hi>ſix</hi> is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect number of all things to be done there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, for Doctrine, Worſhip, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: all their Adminiſtrations are found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and meaſured out from their Canon-Laws, which are all wrapped up in <hi>ſix</hi> Volumes, and the <hi>ſixth</hi> is the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat of them all; therefore the <hi>Pope</hi> makes <hi>ſix</hi> the foundation. This (ſaith Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi>) is but <hi>the number of a man,</hi> that is, a meer humane invention. This 6 is multiplied by 10, becauſe all the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the <hi>Roman</hi> State (ſaith he) is by <hi>Tenths,</hi> by Tithes. All the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple muſt give the <hi>tenth</hi> to the Prieſt, and the Prieſt to the Biſhop.</p>
               <p>To theſe <hi>numbers</hi> may be added the <hi>Virgin number</hi> with the Lamb, which is 144000, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.1.

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:53201:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the clock. See <hi>De Dieu</hi> on <hi>Mark</hi> 15.25.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>John</hi> uſeth the <hi>Roman hours, cha.</hi> 19.14. ſo the <hi>Roman day,</hi> cha. 20.19. <hi>The ſame day at evening being the firſt day of the week, Jeſus,</hi> &amp;c. that could not be the evening before Sun-ſet: for when the two Diſciples went with <hi>Chriſt</hi> to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> it was towards evening, and the day far ſpent. Now they ſupt there, and returned to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which was ſixty furlongs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from <hi>Emmaus,</hi> and (<hi>Luk.</hi> 24.13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) told the Diſciples what had happened to them, then <hi>Chriſt</hi> appeared in the midſt of them, which muſt be at the evening after Sun-ſet, and that not taken after the cuſtom of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> (for then he ſhould not have appeared on the firſt day of the week, but on the ſecond, becauſe they begin their natural day at evening) but of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who reckon their natural day from midnight.</p>
               <p>Hence alſo may that difficulty be clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> calling that day,

               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> divide their <hi>night</hi> into <hi>four watches,</hi> each three hours long.

We read of them, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.15. and 3.1. and 10.3, 9. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.3, 5. ſo that after this account what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever was done after the third, and before the ſixth hour, might be ſaid to have been done the third hour, and ſo ſome recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile <hi>Mark</hi> 15.25. with <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.14. <hi>Chriſt</hi> was crucified the latter end of the third hour, a little before the ſixth, for theſe was no Temple-hour between the third and the ſixth.</p>

                  <p>There was a <hi>Colledge</hi> or School of the Prophets upon the Hill of God, where they trained up young Scholars and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,

                  <p>— Another Colledge at <hi>Naioth</hi> in <hi>Ramah,</hi> whither <hi>David</hi> ſled, and <hi>Saul</hi> followed him, whereof <hi>Samuel</hi> was Overſeer, and Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.19, 20. the Teacher and Inſtructer of thoſe that were called the children of the <hi>Prophets</hi> in that School.

                  <p>By theſe two Inſtances (<hi>ſcil.</hi> of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges at <hi>Gibeah</hi> and <hi>Naioth</hi>) it ſeems that Colledges of Students were priviledged Places, ſeeing the <hi>Iſraelite</hi>-Students in the former were not hurt, though in the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the <hi>Philiſtines:</hi> and <hi>David</hi> was ſecure in the later, though <hi>Saul</hi> was his enemie.</p>
                  <p>There was another Colledge of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> in the time of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> at <hi>Beth-el,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2.3. and another at <hi>Jericho,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2.5.</p>
                  <p>Another at <hi>Gilgal,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4.38, with

                  <p>
                     <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s Colledge was ſo full of Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, that there was not room enough for them, and they deſired it might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.1, 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>Among the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> forty eight <hi>Cities</hi> were appointed for the <hi>Levites,</hi> which were as the common Schools and Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities for the whole Kingdom. See <hi>Willet</hi> in <hi>Dan.</hi> 1.4.</p>
                  <p>Some think, that <hi>Debir</hi> was an Academy or Univerſity of <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> that when the <hi>Jewiſh Polity</hi> came to be fixed, and they were in a ſucceſſion of Government, then they erected publick Schools of Learning, appointed Cities, which to that end they priviledged, as this of <hi>Debir</hi> for one <hi>Joſh.</hi> 15.15.

                  <p>Gods bleſſing upon thoſe Schools of the <hi>Prophets</hi> amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> was ſo great, that upon many in them God beſtowed the extraordinary Gift of foretelling things to come, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.3, 5. and divers Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles were wrought for them: two at <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> one in healing the deadly pottage, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4.38. another in feeding an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of them with twenty Loaves, <hi>verſe</hi> 42, 43, 44. a third at <hi>Jordan,</hi> in cauſing the Axe-head to ſwim, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.5, 6.</p>

                  <p>They were not acted with an <hi>infallible ſpirit</hi> (as the Pen-men of ſacred Writ were) therefore they muſt be read with <hi>conſideration</hi> and <hi>diſcretion;</hi> their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings muſt be tried by the Touchſtone of <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Word.</hi> To be altogether exempt from <hi>Errors</hi> is the <hi>Priviledge</hi> of the <hi>holy Scriptures.</hi>

                  <p>Thus the Spirit of Chriſt teacheth or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily by the word, and the Miniſtery of it (for the Word and the Spirit God hath joyned together, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 59.21.

                  <p>The skill of Husbandry is the Gift of God, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 28.26. God teacheth the <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman</hi> (by his Spirit) how to plow, ſow, reap, and threſh; as he doth the Soldier how to handle his weapon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.34. and 144.1.</p>

                  <p>Much more are <hi>Arts,</hi> and <hi>Tongues,</hi> or <hi>Liberal Sciences,</hi> the Gift of Gods Spirit,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:53201:158" rendition="simple:additions"/>as being more excellent in themſelves, and indeed having more of God in them: and more needful and eminently uſeful for the higheſt Callings, and Imployments, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for the Miniſters of the Goſpel, as hath been demonſtrated.

The Spirit now teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us Arts, and Tongues, as well as the way of preaching, not by revelation, or immediately, as formerly, but by Means, as Schools, Univerſities, and humane Teaching.</p>
                  <p>Hence I infer, that the Teaching of Gods Spirit, as the principal cauſe, doth not exclude the Gifts of the Spirit (and in particular of Arts, and Tongues) from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Inſtruments, which the Spirit uſeth to teach us, and to make us more fit to teach others; conſidering the Spirit of God is the Author of them all, and he, beſtowing them on us, may imploy them, or work by them as ſubſervient to himſelf, as he pleaſeth. As the inward teaching of the Spirit doth not exclude the outward teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Miniſtery of the word (for

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, theſe are not the genuine, or proper effects of Learning in it ſelf, but as it is in men, by reaſon of their corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and of <hi>Satans</hi> tentations. So that all theſe are <hi>Vitia perſonae, non rei,</hi> the faults of the Perſons that are learned, not of the Thing, or of Learning it ſelf.—Or theſe are the effects of Learning abuſed to the perverting of the ſimplicity of the Goſpel; to the putting falſe Gloſſes upon the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; or to the maintaining of Evil in opinion, or practice; and to the ſervice of <hi>Satan</hi> againſt <hi>Chriſt.</hi>—Or theſe are the effects of Learning, prided and gloried in; or overvalued, ſet above its proper place,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:53201:160" rendition="simple:additions"/>and price, and prefer'd before Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the ſaving Graces of it, or repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſufficient to teach <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to convert, and ſave ſouls.</p>
                  <p>Now the carnal abuſe of Learning (no more then of any thing elſe) takes not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the lawful uſe thereof. Not onely Meats, Drinks, Cloaths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but Grace it ſelf, and Reaſon may be abuſed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is demonſtrable by Reaſon, Experience, and Scripture alſo, that humane Learning is good in it ſelf, it being the knowledge of God in the Creatures; and the good Gift of God, who is the Author and Donor of it (as he is of all good) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not enmity, but complacency, or pleaſing to God: and it is good in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural tendency, and efficacy of it. Indeed it is but a ſubordinate good, yet ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to an higher end, both in its Nature, and in Gods appointment and donation of it. God hath ſo wiſely contrived, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered all his Gifts (both ſuperior, and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior) as that they ſhould not claſh toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor one give impediment to another: but all conſpire and move (as wheels in a Clock) to promote the chiefeſt good, that is, Gods Glory, and mans Salvation. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Arts, nor Tongues, nor any other Gift of God, can be any hinderance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:53201:160" rendition="simple:additions"/>except our corruptions make them ſo to be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Learning</hi> in it ſelf, or rightly uſed, is a <hi>threefold Good.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1.

Yea, by the uſe of <hi>Learning</hi> the Heathen have attained to ſo much knowledge of God from the Creatures (ſcil. <hi>of his eternal power and Godhead,</hi> Rom. 1.20.) as made them unexcuſable, though not ſufficient to ſave them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is a <hi>Moral Good,</hi> for regulating, reforming, and reſtraining even carnal men, the very Heathen.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is a <hi>Civil Good,</hi> to qualifie men for all Callings, and employments, (as hath been ſhewed) and for Societies.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <label>Anſw.</label> Though Grace be a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable <hi>Qualification</hi> of a <hi>Goſpel-Miniſter,</hi> and a moſt excellent help, and furtherance,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:53201:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>eminently uſeful to the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, both for performance of the Duty, and for ſucceſs of Labors; and I wiſh, Oh that God would! that all the Miniſters of the Goſpel were Preachers from Grace, as well as from Gifts; from conſcience and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, as well as from ſcience; from their hearts, as well as from their heads: yet it appears not to me, that Grace is <hi>Cauſa ſine qua non,</hi> or of ſo abſolute neceſſity to the Miniſtery, as without which a man cannot be (or ſhould not be allowed, or continued to be) a Miniſter of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>To make good this Aſſertion, I will give three Grounds.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Miniſterial Gifts, and ſaving Graces, are things diſtinct in themſelves, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable in the ſubject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>The Miniſtery of the Goſpel is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by</hi> Chriſt, <hi>principally for the good of others.</hi>

            </p>
            <pb n="261" facs="tcp:53201:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Here I will firſt clear three things, <hi>ſcil.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>What theſe Miniſterial Gifts are.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>That they qualifie men for the work of the Miniſtery.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>That God is the Author and Doner of theſe Gifts to that end.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And afterwards I will ſhew the Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and Separability of Gifts, and ſaving Graces.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>What theſe Miniſterial Gifts are,</hi> which diſpoſe men for that work, and are adequate to the end of the Miniſtery now: theſe are the ordinary</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Gifts</hi> of <hi>common Illumination,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Of Common Illumination, and the effects thereof, ſee Pemble's works, pag. 60. and Dickſon on the Hebr. 6.4, 5, 9. pag. 93.</note> and knowledge of Religion, and the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters thereof, which is attainable either by inward ſenſe and experience, or by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Speculation: and though both theſe do more exactly accompliſh a man for the <hi>Miniſtery,</hi> yet the latter onely may in ſome caſes ſuffice: eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that experience can aſſure us of nothing, that I am to preſs upon others, which Scripture alſo doth not ſuggeſt and confirm.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Gift</hi> of <hi>Preaching, Prophecy,</hi> or <hi>Interpretation</hi> of the Scripture, of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or unfolding, and applying the ſame.</p>
            <pb n="262" facs="tcp:53201:164" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Gifts</hi> of <hi>utterance,</hi> and of <hi>prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Gifts</hi> of <hi>Arts,</hi> and <hi>Tongues,</hi> which are uſeful as handmaids to <hi>Divinity,</hi> and to the <hi>Miniſtery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The <hi>Gift</hi> of <hi>Argumentation,</hi> or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, to confirm or defend the Truth, to confute errors, and convince Gainſayers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond is, that theſe <hi>Miniſterial abilities do qualifie men for the work of the Miniſtery,</hi> as they make them ſuitable and competent thereunto; and fit them to perform their office (and the ſeveral acts thereof) by Gifts: as to pray by a Gift of prayer, to preach by a Gift of preaching, and to diſpute by a Gift or faculty of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; and not to preach other mens Sermons, or ſay other mens prayers only.</p>
            <p>Hence, a man, endowed with good parts, natural and acquired, by diligent reading, ſtudy, diſcourſe, and prayer to God for Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination, Direction, Aſſiſtance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. May attain to a large, clear, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct knowledge of <hi>Religion,</hi> and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Principles and Points of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. May be able to teach the ſame plainly, ſoundly, and profitably to others, to inſtruct, convince, reprove, confirm and comfort others.</p>
            <pb n="263" facs="tcp:53201:164" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p n="3">3. May be through God's bleſſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental for the good of others; for edifying the body of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> for building up in knowledge, faith, holineſs, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; for carrying on the work of the Lord, promoting Reformation, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the ſalvation of others; and for information of ſome (who have Grace real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) of ſome things they knew not before; and for reſolution of ſome doubts and ſcruples.</p>
            <p n="4">4. May be uſeful in the Church of God to defend and maintain the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and all the Points of it (eſpecially Controverſal) againſt the Adverſaries of the Truth and Grace of God, as <hi>Papiſts, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians, Socinians,</hi> and others that are <hi>Heterodox;</hi> which ſome men of great Learning, parts and ſtudies (but it's queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable by their lives and ways, whether they had true ſaving Grace) have done more ſoundly and ſtrenuouſly, even to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing of Gainſayers, and to the ſilencing or ſtopping the mouths of Adverſaries; then many who have true Grace, but want ſuch Gifts, are able to do—<hi>Probatum eſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For there are many real <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who have good experience of the practical part of <hi>Religion,</hi> yet want abilities for the Controverſal part, or defence of the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:53201:165" rendition="simple:additions"/>Truth againſt the oppugners of it.</p>
            <p>Hence alſo I infer, that <hi>datur Medium,</hi> or there is a Mean between a <hi>Miniſters</hi> Preaching from Experience of the <hi>New Birth,</hi> or work of <hi>Grace, &amp;c.</hi> in his own ſoul, which is indeed the moſt comfortable and effectual; and a <hi>Miniſters</hi> taking a Sermon out of a book (which he never made) and getting it by heart, and ſaying, or preaching it.</p>
            <p>The mean between them is a <hi>Miniſters</hi> making of a Sermon by a <hi>Gift</hi> God hath given him, and by ſtudy; and preaching it afterwards, though he hath not the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of it in himſelf.</p>
            <p>As there is a Mean between praying by the Spirit (or the Spirit of Prayer) and reading of a prayer out of a book, or uſing a bare form of prayer; and that Mean is praying by a Gift, or a Gift of prayer.</p>
            <p>As there is a difference between a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars pronouncing an Oration, which he hath onely gotten by heart, and his uttering one he made himſelf, according to the Rules, and Art of Oratory.</p>
            <p>The third thing is, That <hi>God is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and Donor of all Miniſterial Gifts to that end,</hi> that they may qualifie Men for the Work of the <hi>Miniſtery,</hi> whether they be <hi>extraordinary Gifts,</hi> as in former
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:53201:165" rendition="simple:additions"/>times; or <hi>ordinary,</hi> as in our days; which <hi>God</hi> beſtows on ſome men, not on others, as appears by ſome <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which I ſhall endeavor to explane: As,</p>

<note place="margin">Verſe 9.</note> as <hi>Faith,</hi> not <hi>that</hi> we call <hi>ſaving Faith</hi> (which is proper to <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Elect</hi>) but the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Miracles,</hi> —and <hi>the Gifts of Healing,

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Some were <hi>ordinary,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſe 8.</note> to continue in the <hi>Church,</hi> as <hi>the word of wiſdom</hi> to the <hi>Paſtor,</hi> to enable him to apply the Word to the people; and <hi>the word of knowledge</hi> to the <hi>Teacher,</hi> to handle Doctrinal Truths.

            </p>
            <p>The Gifts are divers, as the Offices and Functions in the Church are divers; yet they all flow from one and the ſame Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that is,

            <p>Having declared and cleared theſe three
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:53201:167"/>things, I muſt proceed to ſhew, and prove, That <hi>Miniſterial Gifts and ſaving Graces are diſtinct in themſelves, and ſeparable in the Subject;</hi> which I ſhall endeavor to do by <hi>three Arguments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> I. God gives <hi>Miniſterial Gifts</hi> to many men (as thoſe five fore-named, <hi>ſcil.</hi> of <hi>common Illumination,</hi> of <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> of <hi>Prayer, Utterance,</hi> of <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Tongues,</hi> of <hi>Argumentation</hi>) to whom he gives not <hi>ſaving Grace.</hi> Even common Experience is a plain Evidence, and full Proof hereof. <hi>Ergo, Grace</hi> is not <hi>eſſential</hi> to make a <hi>Miniſter</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As, on the contrary, God gives <hi>Grace</hi> to many, to whom he gives not <hi>Ministerial Gifts. —Ergo,</hi> Theſe are not neceſſary to make a <hi>Christian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But God gives both <hi>Miniſterial Gifts</hi> and <hi>ſaving Graces</hi> to ſome of his ſervants, who are thereby moſt accompliſhed, and <hi>throughly furniſhed unto all good Works,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.16, 17.</note> that is, to all the Services of their <hi>Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Function;</hi> and made moſt <hi>able Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the New Teſtament,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.6.</note> not of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but of the Spirit.</hi> This is appropriated, or peculiar but to ſome <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> not extended or common to them all.</p>

<pb n="269" facs="tcp:53201:167" rendition="simple:additions"/>for kinde to many, to whom he gave no ſaving, ſanctifying Grace; to bad, as well as good. A man might have them, yet miſcarry, and periſh; might want them, yet be ſaved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi>'s words in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. hold forth the <hi>diſtinction</hi> or <hi>ſeparability</hi> of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Gifts,</hi> and <hi>ſaving Graces,</hi> each from other.</p>
            <p>A man may have the <hi>Gift</hi> of <hi>Prophecy</hi> (to propheſie truly, and not be truly god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) and of <hi>Tongues,</hi> &amp;c. A man may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>all myſteries,</hi> and <hi>all knowledge,</hi> and have <hi>all faith,</hi> that is, all the degrees of a <hi>Miracle-working faith,</hi> and yet want <hi>love,</hi> that is <hi>ſaving Grace,</hi> and ſo periſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Baalam</hi> propheſied particularly of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to come; and ſpoke of many things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Iſrael,</hi> foretelling their excellency, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.9. their multiplication, <hi>ver.</hi> 10.
<note place="margin">Piſcator.</note> and happy death. —and he is called a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.16. becauſe ſometimes he had Revelations from the true God, <hi>Num.</hi> 23, and 24. and uttered Divine Oracles as from the mouth of God. And he deſired to <hi>die the death of the righteous,</hi> yet he would not live their life: he was a <hi>wicked man,</hi> a <hi>Soothſayer,</hi> and a <hi>Sorcerer;</hi> he <hi>loved the wages of unrighteouſneſs,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.15. and he was rebuked by the dumb Aſs for
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:53201:168" rendition="simple:additions"/>his iniquity and madneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caiphas</hi> propheſied <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.51, 52. of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that <hi>he ſhould die,</hi> &amp;c. though he ſpake it out of his own malicious ſenſe; thinking it better, that <hi>Christ</hi> ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther periſh, then their Nation.</p>
            <p>Many will plead their extraordinary Gifts,
<note place="margin">Mat. 7.22, 23.</note> and Works, as <hi>Prophecy, Ejection of Devils,</hi> &amp;c. as done in <hi>Christ</hi>'s Name; yet <hi>Christ</hi> will not own them.</p>
            <p>Now if God give <hi>Gifts</hi> both <hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>extraordinary</hi> to ſome, to whom he gives not <hi>ſaving Grace,</hi> then <hi>Miniſterial Gifts</hi> are diſtinct in themſelves, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in the ſubject.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argument</hi> II. (which may give both light and ſtrength to the former) is the <hi>examples</hi> of ſome ſuch, who have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Miniſters and Preachers of God's word, who had Gifts, but no Grace. I will give four inſtances thereof.</p>
            <p>Firſt <hi>Judas.</hi> He had not Grace. <hi>Chriſt</hi> knew it, (though it was not diſcovered to others then what he was) yet he choſe him to bean Apoſtle, and gave him a joynt Commiſſion,
<note place="margin">Judas had the Faith of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and by it wrought Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, ſaith Calvin in 2 Cor. 12.9.</note> equal with the reſt of the Apoſtles to go and preach the Goſpel; and power to work Miracles, &amp; caſt out Devils. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.1, to 9. yea, through the whole Chapter, compare it with <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Mar.</hi>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:53201:168" rendition="simple:additions"/>3.14, 15, to the 20. and 6.7. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.1, 2. They all (that is, the whole twelve Apoſtles) were ſent out; they all did Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; they all caſt out Devils; they all returned to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and gave him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their ſucceſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.6, 10. compar'd with <hi>Mar.</hi> 6.30. God wrought by <hi>Judas</hi> as well as by the reſt. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Judas had part of the Apoſtolical Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery,</hi> Acts 1.17. as truly as any of the reſt. A true Apoſtle, though he proved truly a Reprobate, and Apoſtate, <hi>ver.</hi> 25.</p>
            <p>No difference was diſcerned between <hi>Judas,</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles, in parts, or powers, or pains, or in the ſucceſs of the <hi>Miniſtery:</hi> the Scripture makes no diſtinction between him and them therein; but <hi>Judas,</hi> for any thing the Apoſtles could perceive, was equal to them in all theſe.</p>
            <p>Therefore when <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid, that one of them ſhould betray him, they enquired among themſelves who it ſhould be. <hi>Peter</hi> beckoned to <hi>John</hi> to ask <hi>Chriſt</hi> who it was of whom he ſpake, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.21, to 24. <hi>John</hi> 13.21, to 27.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſt</hi> revealed his minde (touching his Paſſion) to <hi>Judas</hi> as well as to the reſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.17, to 20. and eat the Paſsover (at leaſt) with him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.20. <hi>Luke</hi>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:53201:169" rendition="simple:additions"/>22.14, 15. ſome think, that <hi>Judas</hi> eat the Lord's Supper alſo.</p>
            <p>Alſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> required perſeverance of <hi>Judas,</hi> when he ſaid to the twelve, <hi>Will ye alſo go away? John</hi> 6.67. to wit, in his <hi>Miniſtery</hi> and Diſcipleſhip, or in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and in walking with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> from whom many of his Diſciples went back, and fell off, <hi>ver.</hi> 66. yet <hi>Judas</hi> (as one ſaith) truly practiſed ſecret thieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and injuſtice, even while he exerciſed his publick <hi>Miniſtery, John</hi> 12.6. and <hi>Chriſt</hi> knew he was a Devil; and ſo he would prove himſelf at length, to be a man poſſeſſed and acted by the evil Spirit, <hi>John</hi> 6.70, 71. <hi>Have I not choſen you twelve</hi> (ſaith <hi>Chriſt</hi>) <hi>and one of you is a Devil,</hi> and a <hi>ſon of perdition, John</hi> 17.12. and he was a Traitor, and he did more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> then all the <hi>Jews</hi> did.</p>
            <p>The ſecond <hi>Example.</hi> Thoſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of in <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Who did preach</hi> Chriſt <hi>of envy, and ſtrife,—of contention,</hi> ver. 16. <hi>not of good will, nor ſincerely, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to add affliction to</hi> Paul<hi>'s bonds,</hi> (he being then in priſon at <hi>Rome</hi> for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel) what then ſaith <hi>Paul, ver.</hi> 18. <hi>ſo</hi> Chriſt <hi>be preached,</hi> that is, in true doctrine, though by ſome that did it not of good will, or love, or in truth, (that is, in ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:53201:169" rendition="simple:additions"/>and integrity of minde) but <hi>in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi> only, or out of envy to outſtrip <hi>Paul,</hi> or cruelty to make his chain more heavy, or to procure his death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet <hi>therein I do rejoyce, yea, and will rejoyce;</hi> becauſe by the preaching of theſe, who were inſincere, (ſaith <hi>Piſcator</hi> on this place) as well as of thoſe that were ſincere, <hi>&amp; gloria Chriſti innoteſcit, &amp; ſalus electorum promovetur,</hi> The glory of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was made known, and the ſalvation of the elect promoted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
            <p>Theſe had Gifts, elſe they could not have preached <hi>Chriſt:</hi> but had ſuch any Grace in their hearts? No, their end in it argued a high degree of malice, wickedneſs, and immanity in them. Now, would <hi>Paul</hi> have rejoyced, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was preached, though by ſuch perſons, if he had thought that their preaching could do no good? or that it was not lawful for ſuch to preach?</p>
            <p>The third <hi>Example.</hi>
               <note place="margin">See Beza's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notat. on Mat. 23.2, 3.</note> The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> they <hi>ſit in</hi> Moſes <hi>Chair</hi> (ſaith <hi>Chriſt</hi>) <hi>all therefore, whatſoever they bid you do, obſerve, and do. Chriſt</hi> allowed the people to hear them, therefore he allowed them to teach.</p>
            <p>They ſat in <hi>Moſes</hi> Chair as Teachers, and Expounders of the <hi>Law</hi> by Office; they did ſucceed <hi>Moſes</hi> in the ordinary Office
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:53201:170" rendition="simple:additions"/>of teaching the Word of God: therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> would have them to be heard, though their <hi>perſons</hi> were wicked, leſt their <hi>Miniſtery</hi> (which was the Ordinance of God) ſhould be contemned, and theirs alſo, whom he ſhould after ſend. Though their Actions were not imitable, becauſe <hi>they ſaid,</hi> and <hi>did not,</hi> yet while they ſat in <hi>Moſes</hi> Chair, that is, as long as they preached the Doctrine of <hi>Moſes,</hi> they were to be heard, and therefore they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to teach: they were <hi>true Priests Mal.</hi> 27. by Office, though they were not good and gracious men.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> had Gifts, but no Grace, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.20. and <hi>chap.</hi> 23.13, &amp;c. <hi>Chriſt</hi> denounced many Woes againſt them for their hypocriſie and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; their <hi>Ministery</hi> was but <hi>Legal,</hi> not <hi>Evangelical,</hi> yet <hi>Christ</hi> enjoined his <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples</hi> (who were <hi>Goſpel-believers</hi>) to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, and obſerve their <hi>Miniſtery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is it not lawful now for thoſe <hi>Miniſters</hi> to preach, and for the People to hear them, who, as to their Lives, are not worſe then the <hi>Phariſees;</hi> and who, as for their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, are better, <hi>ſcil.</hi> who preach <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Goſpel</hi> truly, which the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> did not at all?</p>

               <hi>Paul</hi> calls and acknowledgeth to be his <hi>fellow-Laborer,</hi> Philem. 24. to wit, in the Work of the <hi>Miniſtery,</hi>

               <hi>Byfield</hi> on <hi>Col.</hi> 4.14. and <hi>Elton</hi> on that place conceive, that <hi>Demas</hi> forſook <hi>Paul,</hi> and fell away after he had been his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion and Fellow-laborer.—See <hi>Hyper.</hi> on 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10.</p>

            <p>He affirms alſo, that his Epiſtle to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon</hi> was written <hi>anno Chriſti</hi> 56. <hi>Nero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> in his <hi>Digeſt</hi> placeth the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy</hi> as the laſt of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, which he writ before his <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> or <hi>Beheading;</hi> after that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle

            <p>Mr. <hi>Roberts,</hi> in his <hi>Key of the Bible,</hi> the ſecond part, in his <hi>Chronological Table</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> gives Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why the Epiſtle to <hi>Philemon</hi> was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before the ſecond Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> before <hi>Demas</hi> his Deſertion, or <hi>Demas</hi> had returned again unto <hi>Paul.</hi> In <hi>pag.</hi> 763. he ſaith, that <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his ſecond Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy</hi> laſt of all thoſe Epiſtles he wrote, a little before his <hi>Martydom,</hi> as all circumſtances evince, and the Epiſtle it ſelf intimateth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.6.

            <p>By this it is probable, that <hi>Demas</hi> never recovered his fall, nor returned to <hi>Paul</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> III. Miniſterial Gifts, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Graces, are diſtinct and ſeparable, and go not alway together: otherwiſe no man could be a gracious man, but he that hath Miniſterial gifts; and no man could have Miniſterial gifts, but he that hath Grace: both which are apparently falſe in common experience.</p>
            <pb n="278" facs="tcp:53201:172" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Hence great Parts, and eminent Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in matters of Religion, are no ſure ſigns of Grace, they may make a man <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, able to teach others, not holy himſelf.</p>
            <p>Though theſe Gifts alone, be they never ſo excellent and uſeful in themſelves, and to others, yet without Grace. they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſave thoſe that have them, nor enable them to act out of pure love to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſouls, or out of ſincere deſire to Gods Glory: but they are like the Carpenters, that built an Ark to ſave <hi>Noah,</hi> and his Family, and periſhed themſelves in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: or like the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> that did help to build the Temple, but did not worſhip God in it, nor partake of the priviledges of it.</p>

<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12 7. and 14, 12.</note> or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon God uſeth, be not ſanctified here, nor ſhall be ſaved hereafter. A Miniſter may <hi>preach to others, and himſelf be a caſt-away,</hi>

            <p>If a mans Miniſtery may (by <hi>Chriſts</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment) do good to others, though he be not ſanctified, and ſaved himſelf, then Grace is not eſſential to a Miniſter of the Goſpel.</p>

            <p>Maſter <hi>Paul Bain</hi> in his Comment on <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. ſaith, <hi>There are three ſorts of Miniſters,</hi> 1. <hi>ſome are ignorant and ſcandalous:</hi> 2. <hi>ſome of knowledge, and free from crime, but unſanctified:</hi> 3. <hi>ſome are truely ſanctified.

<note place="margin">Mat. 7.23.</note> The third ſort are thoſe, that are qualified, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and ſanctified inwardly. Now theſe are given of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>as men according to his own heart, that is, delegated by him.</hi>

No man will be ſo without ſenſe to affirm it. Why then? ſhall the courſe of Preaching be condemned for the ſuppoſed miſdemeanors of them that Preach?

            <p n="1">1. God doth require them to do the ſame.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though they ſin in doing them, yet it's a greater Sin not to do them.</p>

            <p n="4">4. They may be inſtrumental for the good of others thereby.</p>
            <p n="1">I. They may be ſuch things in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (or for the matter of them) as God
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:53201:182" rendition="simple:additions"/>requires, or which are their Duty to do; as Praying, Hearing, Praiſing God.</p>
            <p>Duties of the Moral Law, which all men (even bad, as well as good) are bound unto: As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To <hi>pray</hi> to God. The neglect hereof is noted as a ſin in the very <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt,</hi> that <hi>fool,</hi> who <hi>ſaith in his heart, There is no God,</hi> Pſal. 14.1, 4. in the <hi>workers</hi> of <hi>iniquity,</hi> Pſal. 53.4. in the very <hi>Heathen,</hi> for which <hi>God</hi> poureth forth his <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>judgement,</hi> Pſal. 79.6. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.25. Even by the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> all men are bound to <hi>pray</hi> unto <hi>God,</hi> as the <hi>Mariners</hi> in <hi>Jonah</hi> 1.6. acknowledged in a <hi>tempeſt;</hi> and by the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Creation</hi> to ſeek to <hi>God</hi> for what they want.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To <hi>praiſe,</hi> and give thanks to <hi>God</hi> for his Mercies. <hi>David</hi> excites all the <hi>Creatures</hi> to <hi>praiſe God,</hi> as a natural Duty according to their ſeveral capacities, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.21. <hi>Let all fleſh bleſs his holy Name.</hi> And verſ. 10. <hi>All thy Works ſhall praiſe thee, O Lord, and thy Saints ſhall bleſs thee.</hi> God hath given a general Command to all men upon Earth <hi>to ſing unto the Lord,</hi> that is, <hi>to praiſe the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 68.2. and 96.1.</p>
            <p>So that Prayer and Praiſe are Natural Duties, impoſed and incumbent upon all
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:53201:182" rendition="simple:additions"/>men, as they are men; and part of the Natural Worſhip, which all are bound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Law</hi> of their <hi>Creation,</hi> to perform to God, as obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory to all Mankinde, even to the wicked.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Though the wicked cannot perform theſe Duties of Prayer, Praiſes, Hearing aright, or without ſin (as to the maner of doing them) but they diſpleaſe God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; yet it is a greater ſin in any, even in the wicked (and ſhews more ſlighting of God, and diſregard to God) to neglect or omit the matter of a Duty (or the Duty it ſelf) as not to pray, not to praiſe God, not to hear the word, then to fail, fall ſhort, or miſcarry in the maner of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; as not to perform theſe aright, <hi>ſcil.</hi> in faith and fervency, with affection and ſincerity. This is a greater ſin, becauſe to omit the Duty wholly, as to the matter of it, is (as one ſaith) to diſobey totally: to ſin in the maner of doing it is to diſobey God but in part onely.</p>
            <p>In performance there is ſome good, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the matter of the Duty, or the thing done: it may be ſome acts or circumſtances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides may be good (<hi>materially,</hi> though not <hi>formally</hi>) but in omiſſion of Duties there is no good at all: now <hi>ubi major pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatio
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:53201:183" rendition="simple:additions"/>boni, ibi majus malum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They do evil, that pray, praiſe God, or hear the Word amiſs; but they do worſe, that do not theſe at all.</p>
            <p n="3">III. God may <hi>reward</hi> men for the <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riality</hi> of their Duties, or for the things they do (as being good in themſelves) though he utterly diſlike the <hi>formality</hi> thereof, or their maner of doing them. God hath, out of his infinite goodneſs, ſometimes ſhewed reſpect to the good things that have been done, even by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men (though they were but the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, and wanted the ſoul and life of good Works) ſo as to reward them temporally.</p>
            <p>Thus God heard the Prayer of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> though a profane wretch, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.9, 10, 17. and <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Prayer, when he was humbled by fear, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.29. See how it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with God to defer a temporary Judgement, and to grant ſome Deliverance to <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> when he humbled himſelf (which ſome think was but outwardly) 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.6, 7, 14. External Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation may prevail to remove an outward Judgement, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.27.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The Services even of thoſe that were unſanctified may be <hi>inſtrumental for the good of others;</hi> as the Teachings of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> were: they were
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:53201:183" rendition="simple:additions"/>grand Hypocrites, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet <hi>Chriſt</hi> allowed them to teach (and take his Statutes and Covenant into their mouths) elſe he would not have bidden others hear them, <hi>ſcil.</hi> for the benefit they might get by their Doctrine, more then by their Examples; for <hi>they ſaid,</hi> and <hi>did not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third <hi>thing</hi> is, God's Expoſtulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Sinners about their Services, or Performances, ſeems to imply, not a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of ſuch things as Duty obliged them to do, but rather a Reprehenſion of them; Either</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the <hi>maner,</hi> that they did them amiſs, not ſo as he preſcribed, or otherwiſe then he required; or <hi>end,</hi> as ſeeking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves therein, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 10.2.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Or for their <hi>unſuitable carriage,</hi> or <hi>bad lives</hi> accompanying the ſame.</p>
            <p>Hereupon God rejected their Services, and expreſſed his diſlike of them, as being not his, but theirs, becauſe of the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties inherent in their Perſons, or practiſed in their Actions, or adherent to their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in their performance of them.</p>
            <p>God reprehended the <hi>Jews</hi> (in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulation with them) <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.10, to 16. not ſimply for their <hi>Sacrifices</hi> and <hi>Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, —ſolemn Feaſts</hi> and <hi>Aſſemblies,</hi> as <hi>treading in his Courts, making Prayers,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:53201:184" rendition="simple:additions"/>becauſe God had commanded all theſe to be done as their Duties, (yea, God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of his People ſometime for the want of theſe, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 43.22, 23, 24.) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not do theſe aright; they did them hypocritically, not ſincerely, without due affection and devotion of heart, and outward reformation of life: and their <hi>hands,</hi> wherewith they brought and offered their Sacrifices, and which they ſpread forth in Prayer, <hi>were full of blood, Iſai.</hi> 1.15. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> Cruelty, Oppreſſion, Murder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore God refuſeth to own, or to accept theſe their Duties, or Services, as being done</p>
            <p n="1">1. By ſuch <hi>perſons</hi> as they were.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In ſuch a <hi>maner</hi> as they did them.</p>
            <p>Yea, they were abhorred of him.</p>
            <p>See the like Expoſtulation of God with his People <hi>Jerem.</hi> 6.20. <hi>To what purpoſe cometh there to me Incenſe from</hi> Sheba? <hi>&amp;c. your Burnt-offerings are not acceptable, nor your Sacrifices ſweet to me.</hi> God tells them that their Services were none of them pleaſing to him, becauſe they rejected his Laws, and wilfully ſaid, <hi>We will not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi> ſcil. <hi>to the Prophets,</hi> verſ. 17, 19. and their lives and courſes were diſpleaſing to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſt</hi> reproved the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees</hi>
               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:53201:184" rendition="simple:additions"/>in <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.23. not for <hi>tithing Mint, Aniſe, and Cummin,</hi> (for theſe were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Law, <hi>Levit.</hi> 27.30.) but for <hi>omitting the weightier matters of the Law, as Judgement, Mercy, and Faith: theſe ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. Chriſt</hi> blames not thoſe that do the ſmalleſt things command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (as ſome expound this place) but thoſe that think, when they have done theſe,
<note place="margin">Annotat.</note> they have done all that is required, and ſo ſecurely neglect the greateſt Duties.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> reproved the <hi>Jew</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.17, to 23. not for teaching others, but for not teaching himſelf, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. or for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the contrary himſelf to what he taught others, as <hi>ſtealing, committing adultery,</hi> verſ. 22. not for <hi>abhorring Idols,</hi> but for doing as ill, or worſe, that is, <hi>committing ſacriledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>May it not be conceived, that God in this <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.16. reprehends the wicked, not ſimply for <hi>declaring his Statutes</hi> and <hi>Words,</hi> but for the maner, becauſe <hi>they did it in hypocriſie;</hi> and for the concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants thereof in them, <hi>ſeeing they hated Inſtruction,</hi> and <hi>rejected his Words,</hi> v. 17.</p>
            <p>And may not theſe words, <hi>What haſt thou to do to declare my Statutes?</hi> &amp;c. be underſtood rather as an Expoſtulation

None can ſhine as <hi>Stars</hi> in the Kingdom of Heaven, which do not enter into it, which without Converſion none can. Therefore the place objected muſt not be thought to reſpect any that are unregenerate. For Glory ever ſuppoſeth Grace. And thoſe, that have Grace to carry them to Heaven, ſhall, if they here turn many to Righteouſneſs, have greater degrees of Glory when they come there.</p>
